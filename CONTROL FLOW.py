# Question 07
 # This example misses indentations to be correct.
 # Insert the missing indentation to make the code correct
if 5 > 2:

if 5 > 2: print("Five is greater than two!")


#Question 09
 # Use the correct short hand syntax to write the following conditional expression in one line
print("Yes")  if 5 > 2  else print("No")
